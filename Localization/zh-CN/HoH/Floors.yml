  "Shark" and "Amikiri" can rip your head clean off, so look out!
  There are some wall traps to watch out for too.
  Floors 1-6 have no bronze chests, and so no mimics.
  They also do not drop magicite or pomanders of "Alteration", "Purity", "Serenity", "Petrification", "Concealment", or "Raising".
  All of these can be found starting at floor 7, with the exception of elder magicite, which cannot be found until floor 31.
  Pomanders of "Affluence", "Flight", and "Alteration" do not drop on floor 9.
HoH11: |
  Be aware of the Hands' enrage.
  Also, there are some wall traps here.
  Floor 15 is always a hall of fallacies.
  Elder magicite cannot be found in this set.
  Pomanders of "Affluence", "Flight", and "Alteration" do not drop on floor 19.

  在这个集合中找不到每个异常的
  老魔法集。
  “影响”、“飞行”和“改变”等浮动者不会在29楼下掉落。
HoH31: |
  Be aware of "Harakiri" and "Onmitsu" enrages.
  There are two different enemies named "Onmitsu" - one a patrol, and one not.
  Elder magicite is a possible find starting in this set.
  Pomanders of "Affluence", "Flight", and "Alteration" do not drop on floor 39.
  Gold sacks are a possible find starting in this set.
HoH41: |
  Be aware of "Sekiban" and "Mizumimizu" enrages, and also the wall trap on these floors.
  Some odd notes about the enemies...
    There are two different enemies named "Sekizo" - one a patrol, and one not.
      They are both golems, but look different.
    There are two different enemies named "Iseki".
      They are both Maroliths, but one is green, and the other is purple.
    There are two different enemies named "Saikoro".
      They are identical except that one casts Aero while the other casts Tornado, and they appear on different floors.
  Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 49.
HoH51: |
  意识到“Kongorei”和“Tesso”两枚炮弹、“Naga”Baleful Roar和“Rachimonai”从AoEs战斗中分离。
  也知道这些楼层上的墙壁陷阱。
HoH61: |
  Mimics are in gold chests and cannot be stunned starting on this set.
  "Onryo" are the worst thing to fight here, but they're proximity agro, so you won't always be able to avoid them.
  Be aware of the wall trap on these floors.
HoH71: |
  Platinum sacks are a possible find starting in this set.
  You'll likely want to pop pomanders of raising and intuition at the start of this set.
  Do be careful running into the middle of rooms to collect hoards though, as traps are often deadly here.
  It's safest if you've used a pomander of safety, sight, or concealment,
    or if you're planning to use a pomander of petrification or a magicite.
  This is the last set in which you can find pomanders of raising, though they are at an increased rate.
  Watch out for the wraiths' and elbsts' out of combat AoEs as they can one shot you if you're not paying attention.
  Mammoths can also cause problems if you're concealed.
  There are a lot of large AoEs in these floors - make sure you're familiar and know how to avoid or stop them.
  Floors 71-73 are known to have a lot of landmines.
  Tanks especially can use pomander of sight on these floors to take advantage of this.
  Be aware of the wall trap on these floors.
HoH81: |
  Don't forget to use a pomander of raising at the start of the set. More cannot be found here, unfortunately.
  Be very careful if you're going for hoards!
  Floors 84-86 are the worst, mainly due to Shinzei patrols that nobody wants to fight.
  These are usually good candidates for flight/alteration/petrification/magicite.
  Floors 87-89 are known to have a lot of landmines.
  Tanks especially can use pomander of sight on these floors to take advantage of this.
HoH91: |
  别忘了在集合开始时使用一个渐变器。不幸的是，在这里找不到更多的人。
  非常小心，如果你要到屋顶！
  Floors 91-93, 最好的解决方法是单人WHM。
    如果你可以轻松拿起石币，你可以避免造成任何伤害。
    您可以在 11 + 台上练习在 Sprites 上进行循环，因为这不是一件容易的事。
    你很可能想要避免警告。
  层94-96在这个组合中是最坏的，所以最好是使用飞行/更改/肽/魔法开启。
  底层97-99实际上有最容易的敌人。
  地板99保证有3个附魔，所以你可以尽最大努力为它保存一个安宁。
